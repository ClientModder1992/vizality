/**
 * ----------------
 * Javascript Oddities
 * ----------------
 * These are what I feel are strange things I've come across in my time using Javascript
 * that I feel can be good to know/be aware of.
 * ----------------
 * • typeof null -> 'object'
 * • null instanceof Object -> false
 * • typeof NaN -> 'number'
 * • NaN === NaN -> false
 * • NaN !== NaN -> true
 * • .2 + .1 -> 0.30000000000000004
 * • true + true -> 2

/**
 * ----------------
 * Todo Anootations
 * ----------------
 * These todo annotations are used throughout the source code, and they're pretty
 * self-explanatory but helpful to be aware of.
 * ----------------
 * @todo Task that has yet to be completed
 * @bug Problem that produces some inconsistent or incorrect results
 * @deprecated Code that will be removed in the future
 * @docs Indication that the section needs to have proper documentation added
 * @experimental Code that is not fully tested and possibly unstable
 * @note Generic message meant to explain or point out something
 * @i18n Indication that the section needs to have proper internationalization added
 * @powercord Code that is a remnant of Powercord and needs to be removed
 * @test Information for testing a certain scenario, or code that needs to be tested

/**
 * ----------------
 * Webpack Modules
 * ----------------
 * Below are some potentially useful webpack modules that need to be explored further.
 * ----------------
 * vizality.modules.webpack.getModule('getHighestRole')
 * vizality.modules.webpack.getModule('getGuildPermissions')
 * vizality.modules.webpack.getModule('isStreaming')
 * vizality.modules.webpack.getModule('getActivity') // Spotify stuff
 * vizality.modules.webpack.getModule('isEmojiDisabled')
 * vizality.modules.webpack.getModule('getClass')
 */

 /**
 * ----------------
 * Type Definitions
 * ----------------
 * In order to get proper intellisense in VSCode for the custom-defined types the project
 * uses, this file must remain opened. I was not able to find a viable workaround to
 * importing typedefs into individual files, so this was the only solution that worked for
 * me for cross-file types. In order for it to work, I also had to add the path to the
 * typedef file to jsconfig.json.
 * ----------------
 * File location: ./src/core/typedefs/index.js
