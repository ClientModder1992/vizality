# Vizality

Vizality is a @discordapp client modification based on [Powercord](https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord). It shares essentially the same, but slightly modifed, API and features. I have also tried to add additional features and UI improvements.

This version has been tailored to my ideals and what I think makes a better modding experience for the average user. The idea revolves around providing a built-in Style Editor for users who don't have much/any knowledge of CSS, or simply want to customize things easier and more quickly. This will be done by creating a Sass framework based around CSS custom properties.
