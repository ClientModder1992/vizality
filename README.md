# Vizality

Vizality is a @discord client modification based on Powercord. It shares essentially the same, but slightly modifed, API and features. We have also tried to add additional features and UI improvements.

This version has been tailored to a slightly different set of ideals and what we think makes a better modding experience for the average user. The idea revolves around providing a built-in Style Editor for users who don't have much/any knowledge of CSS, or simply want to customize things easier and more quickly. This will be done by creating a sort of Sass framework based around CSS custom properties.
